# Project Agenda

- [ ] 🙋‍♀️ **Add full project description in README.**
- [ ]    **In a week and then in a month:**  
  The bot should trigger a message:  
  "Thank you for using this bot, it's totally free for you, but it consumes resources. If you'd like to support it, visit [this link](https://ogabeeek.notion.site/Thk-u-135bc0d823c3805381f2f38ac074a2c8?pvs=4)."
- [ ]    **Statistics Enhancement:**  
  Stats should be available not only by @user_name but also with the chat name.
- [ ] 🙋 **Message Separation Issue:**  
  The bot currently remembers messages from other chats. Each group should be independent.  
  *Suggestion:* All functions should collect and respond according to each group's unique ID.
- [ ] 🙋 **DataBase:**  
    Integrade database to mongoDB online
- [ ] 🙋‍♀️ **Function Separation:**  
  "Remember," stats, summary, and topic statements should be separated.
- [ ] 🙋‍♀️ **Engagement Function:**  
  Create a function that occasionally engages the chat by adding comments, gifts, or other media.
- [ ]    **Documentation:**  
  Add documentation to the functions.
- [ ] 🙋‍♀️ **Additional Custom Functions:**  
  Implement your own additional functions as needed.
